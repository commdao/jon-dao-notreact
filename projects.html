        <h4>Why Make This?</h4>
        <p>The number one reason being <em>I</em> need it. I can try to block off time in the day to give myself a schedule, but there's no guarantee that those hours set aside will be productive. My brain handles chunks better than blocks, so I've had a lot more success with short bursts using a focus timer.</p>
        <h4>Learning Points</h4>
        <p>The mechanics of a countdown timer aren't too complex since you're just taking advantange of a decreasing incrementer (de-incrementer?). More than that, this project gave me the biggest growth and challenge in trying to create a design that's simple but appealing while being responsive to mobile layout. Originally I had tied a function to the refresh icon that would simply reload the entire page because I was having trouble creating the right type of function to restore the icons properly. It worked, but it had a slight delay, and it really hindered the responsive experience. Main tab focus pause</p>
        <h4>What's Next?</h4>
        <p>I'd like to add some sort of local storage component that could keep track of the spread of alloted time. For example, by end of day, you dedicated X hours for Business, Y hours for Study, and Z for Gaming. Could even throw in an experience bar and badges, but that sort of gamification never provided much incentive for me personally.</p>
