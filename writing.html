    <p>For the past decade, nearly all the blogs and articles I've written were in a self-help style on <a href="https://commdao.com/2015/05/04/i-feel-like-i-dont-belong/" target="_blank">communication</a> and <a href="https://aoabbu.wordpress.com/2019/05/27/managing-gym-intimidation/" target="_blank">fitness</a>.</p>
    <p>I've neglected what made me fall in love with writing. Fiction. Stories. Crafting and drafting the absurd, while still finding ways to weave in emotional impact. That's why I was a writing minor to begin with!</p>
    <p>With that passion reignited, I completed <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a> for the first time in 2022, and I hope to do it again this year.</p>
    <p>I've got my eyes peeled for other contests and events to join. You can read my submission to last year's <a href="https://theghoststory.com/tgs-fiction-award" target="_blank">Ghost Story Supernatural Fiction Award</a> below.</p>
