      <h3>Written Works</h3><br>
      <p>For the past decade, nearly all the blogs and articles I've written were in a self-help style on <a href="https://commdao.com/2015/05/04/i-feel-like-i-dont-belong/" target="_blank">communication</a> and <a href="https://aoabbu.wordpress.com/2019/05/27/managing-gym-intimidation/" target="_blank">fitness</a>.</p>
      <p>I've neglected what made me fall in love with writing. Fiction. Stories. Crafting and drafting the absurd, while still finding ways to weave in emotional impact. That's why I was a writing minor to begin with!</p>
      <p>With that passion reignited, I completed <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a> for the first time in 2022, and I hope to do it again this year.</p>
      <p>I've got my eyes peeled for other contests and events to join. You can read my submission to last year's <a href="https://theghoststory.com/tgs-fiction-award" target="_blank">Ghost Story Supernatural Fiction Award</a> below.</p>

      <h3>BlackJackJonny</h3><br>
      <p>Music is life! Whether it's rapping on mixtapes to stay in touch with friends overseas or teaching myself guitar to try to impress girls-- music is tied to so many influential memories. And yet, just like writing, I've neglected it for years. 
        I'm slowly studying drums, so I can build a better understanding to make my own beats. But honestly, I've been distracted with making mashups after figuring out the Camelot Wheel. 
      <p>After I expand my catalogue of original tunes, I'll set up a proper Spotify artist page. In the meantime, <a href="https://beamish-baklava-7e1a30.netlify.app/" target="_blank">I made a mock up</a> with some of my best hits.</p>

        <h3>Focus Nau (Focus Timer)</h3>
        <h4>Why Make This?</h4>
        <p>The number one reason being <em>I</em> need it. I can try to block off time in the day to give myself a schedule, but there's no guarantee that those hours set aside will be productive. My brain handles chunks better than blocks, so I've had a lot more success with short bursts using a focus timer.</p>
        <h4>Learning Points</h4>
        <p>The mechanics of a countdown timer aren't too complex since you're just taking advantange of a decreasing incrementer (de-incrementer?). More than that, this project gave me the biggest growth and challenge in trying to create a design that's simple but appealing while being responsive to mobile layout. Originally I had tied a function to the refresh icon that would simply reload the entire page because I was having trouble creating the right type of function to restore the icons properly. It worked, but it had a slight delay, and it really hindered the responsive experience. Main tab focus pause</p>
        <h4>What's Next?</h4>
        <p>I'd like to add some sort of local storage component that could keep track of the spread of alloted time. For example, by end of day, you dedicated X hours for Business, Y hours for Study, and Z for Gaming. Could even throw in an experience bar and badges, but that sort of gamification never provided much incentive for me personally.</p>
