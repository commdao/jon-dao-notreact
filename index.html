      <h3>Works</h3><br>
      <p>So, I could dig and pull from a decade back a list of articles I've written that were published. But, they'd all be e-learning, language, or fitness focused. And for the future, that's not the kind of writing I want to do!</p><br>
      <p>Currently on the docket is submitting to this year's <a href="https://theghoststory.com/tgs-fiction-award">Ghost Story Supernatural Fiction Award</a>, where I'm likely to become a two-time reject. Then, I'll participate in the <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">2023 NaNoWriMo</a>, where I hope to be a two-time completionist!</p>

      <h3>BlackJackJonny</h3><br>
      <p>I was supposed to learn drums properly in 2022, but I got a bit distracted with music theory and making mashups. As soon as get more original remixes in order, I'll set up a proper Spotify page. In the meantime, <a href="https://beamish-baklava-7e1a30.netlify.app/">I made a mock up</a> with some of my best hits. Choice YouTube playlists below:</p>

        <h3>Focus Nau</h3>
        <h4>Why Make This?</h4>
        <p>The number one reason being <em>I</em> need it. I can try to block off time in the day to give myself a schedule, but there's no guarantee that those hours set aside will be productive. My brain handles chunks better than blocks, so I've had a lot more success with short bursts using a focus timer.</p>
        <h4>Learning Points</h4>
        <p>The mechanics of a countdown timer aren't too complex since you're just taking advantange of a decreasing incrementer (de-incrementer?). More than that, this project gave me the biggest growth and challenge in trying to create a design that's simple but appealing while being responsive to mobile layout. Originally I had tied a function to the refresh icon that would simply reload the entire page because I was having trouble creating the right type of function to restore the icons properly. It worked, but it had a slight delay, and it really hindered the responsive experience. Main tab focus pause</p>
        <h4>What's Next?</h4>
        <p>I'd like to add some sort of local storage component that could keep track of the spread of alloted time. For example, by end of day, you dedicated X hours for Business, Y hours for Study, and Z for Gaming. Could even throw in an experience bar and badges, but that sort of gamification never provided much incentive for me personally.</p>

      <p>Whoops. From now on!</p><br>
      <p>One of those YouTube videos said front-end devs should put a picture of themselves on their site. Do I really?</p><br>
      <p>Site is just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS for now. React is next.</p>
